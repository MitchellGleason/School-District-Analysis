# School District Analysis
## Challenge Overview
This assignment consists of five technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver the results

- Deliverable 1: Collect the student data into a DataFrame.
- Deliverable 2: Prepare a cleaned version of the DataFrame.
- Deliverable 3: Summarize key pieces of the data.
- Deliverable 4: Drill down into the data to analyze specific subsets.
- Deliverable 5: Compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions.
- Deliverable 6: A written analysis of your results (README.md).

## Analysis and Results
The data and calculations done above provide us with a number of discoveries. The most obvious discovery here are the differences seen between the two different types of schools, charter and public. The first of these comparisons was done with the average reading score and average math score. Charter schools had an average reading score of 72.45 while public schools had an average reading score of 72.28. Charter schools had an average math score of 66.76 while public schools had an average math score of 62.95. While the difference between reading scores is negligible, there are overall slightly better math scores by students enrolled in charter schools.

This difference is interesting in context with the very next comparison between the school budget of charter and public schools. Public schools in this data have an average budget of $38,570 more. An assumption that a larger budget provides higher grades is disproven within this dataset. One additional analysis that could be useful with this dataset would be a comparison between student counts at charter vs. public schools. The student count calculation that was completed was only grouped by individual schools, and this table shows that there is a large discrepancy between the most and least populated schools. If charter schools have a statistically noticeable lower student count, this can affect the data for average grades.
